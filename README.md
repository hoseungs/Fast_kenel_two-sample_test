# Fast_kenel_two-sample_test

Code to reproduce simulation results from “A fast and effective large-scale two-sample test” by Hoseung Song and Hao Chen.

## Code

* main_function: contain main functions of the proposed method. It consists of R version and Python version.

* simulation: contain source functions generating simulations and produce results in Section 3. "RunMe" files produce simulation results.
  + simulation1: produce results in Section 3.1.
  + simulation2: produce results in Section 3.2.
  + simulation3: produce results in Section 3.3.
